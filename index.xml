Garner is back for the movie version, playing a marshal named Zane Cooper, and the Bret Maverick role is played by Mel Gibson.
It is a tribute to Gibson, I think, that he can play scenes side by side with the man who originated the character, and produce much the same effect, as a smiling card shark who hopes to win money by playing poker and not get shot in the process.</description></item><item><title>Michael Corleone Blanco's Bio and Net Worth of Griselda Blanco's Son</title><link>/michael-corleone-blancos-bio-and-net-worth-of-griselda-blancos-son.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/michael-corleone-blancos-bio-and-net-worth-of-griselda-blancos-son.html</guid><description>Michael Corleone Blanco is a Colombian businessman, reality TV personality, and former Columbian drug lord best known as the son of “The Black Widow”, Griselda Blanco.&amp;nbsp;Aged 45, Michael, born on August 5, 1978, was a drug lord before going into legitimate business.
