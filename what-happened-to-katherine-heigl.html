The former Grey’s Anatomy star was labeled “difficult” to work with and over several years slowly faded into the background.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>Heigl’s seemingly outspoken nature wound up hindering her ability to nab roles she otherwise would’ve been a shoo-in for. The few films she did star in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post-Grey’s Anatomy</a> received less than satisfactory ratings, namely&nbsp;2010’s Killers&nbsp;(10 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) and&nbsp;Life As We Know It&nbsp;(29 percent).</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>While Rotten Tomatoes is not an indication of a film’s financial performance, it does allude to a shift in both audience and critical opinion. Before her slew of comments in 2007, Heigl had been making a name for herself on the silver screen in films like 27 Dresses&nbsp;and&nbsp;Knocked Up.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>Now, after all these years, we can’t help but wonder what she is up to.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>But first, what happened?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Katherine-Heigl-.jpg><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>Heigl’s very public “shunning” began in 2007 when she called the popular comedy Knocked Up, in which she starred alongside Seth Rogen, “a little sexist.” She went on the record with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> saying the film “…paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys… It was hard for me to love the movie.”</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=153 data-injectable=false>Was Heigl completely wrong? The present-day versions of ourselves would likely say no. But that didn’t stop Seth Rogan from getting his feelings hurt.</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>In 2016, almost a decade after Heigl’s public comment, Rogan told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>:</p><p>“I respect the fact that perhaps she realizes that it has hurt her career, and I don’t want that to have happened to her at all because I’ve said a thousand stupid things and I really like her… For other people to not work with her because she didn’t like her experience with us is — I think is crazy.”</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>It was from this Vanity Fair interview in 2007 that opinions about Heigl began to form, such as her being pegged as “difficult.” In that same interview, Heigl called her Grey’s Anatomy character Izzie Stevens’ storyline “a ratings ploy,” which naturally didn’t sit well with the creators and writers of the show.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>Heigl added fuel to the fire in 2008 when she turned down an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Stevens because, as she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider</a>, “I did not feel that I was given the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination… I did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials.”</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>If the writers of Grey’s Anatomy hadn’t had their feelings hurt the first time around, they definitely did now. Keep in mind that Heigl won an Emmy for her role as Stevens the year before, so naturally, Shonda Rhimes ⏤ the showrunner, creator, head writer, and executive producer of Grey’s ⏤ was offended by the comment. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rhimes went on record years later</a> saying that “no Heigls” were allowed on the set of Scandal. Ouch.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>If that wasn’t enough, Heigl made a cringe-worthy appearance on Late Show with David Letterman in 2009 (a year after pulling her name from the Emmys) where she made several more eyebrow-raising comments. When asked by Letterman about how it felt to be back filming Grey’s Anatomy after the break between seasons, Heigl said:</p><p>“Our first day back was Wednesday, and it was ⏤ I’m going to keep saying this because I hope it embarrasses them ⏤ a 17-hour day, which I think is cruel and mean.”</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Needless to say, the comment did not go over well.&nbsp;The following year her character was written out of Grey’s Anatomy and in the decade that followed she managed to only star in a little over a dozen movie and TV shows.</p><h2 id=h-so-what-s-katherine-heigl-up-to-now data-injectable=false>So, what’s Katherine Heigl up to now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-588295934.jpg><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Heigl’s roles since the late 2000s include television shows such as State of Affairs (2014 – 2015) and Doubt (2017), both of which did not perform well and did not go beyond one season. She also starred in a few other films that didn’t necessarily tank but also didn’t soar, such as the 2012 film One for the Money and the 2021 film Fear of Rain.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>In 2021 she signed on as one of the executive producers and the titular star of the Netflix series Firefly Lane based on the Kristin Hannah book of the same name. The show depicts the lifelong friendship between Tully (Heigl) and Kate (Sarah Chalke) over 30 years of ups and downs.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>While Heigl does star in the show, she said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a>, “I spent a lot of years just being the actor hired. I feel now I have enough experience and enough wisdom to have a voice, to collaborate about character, about story, about cast.”</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>In that same interview, she opened up about life after her public shunning, specifically, those comments she made between 2007 and 2009. But if you expected an apology, think again.</p><p>“I may have said a couple of things you didn’t like, but then that escalated to ‘she’s ungrateful,’ then that escalated to ‘she’s difficult,’ and that escalated to ‘she’s unprofessional.’ What is your definition of difficult? Somebody with an opinion that you don’t like? Now, I’m 42, and that – pisses me off.”</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>In 2023, Heigl reunited with her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">former Grey’s Anatomy co-star</a> Ellen Pompeo in a touching interview on Variety‘s Actors on Actors. The pair discussed their rise to stardom, the headiness of fame, and in Heigl’s case, the naiveté that comes with youth.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>More importantly, Heigl addressed the “villain” role so many people boxed her into during the late 2000s and early 2010s, saying, “You know what I love? There’s two roles women fit into: victim or villain. And the women who are victims are only victims because they don’t have the guts to be the villain.” As our very own <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashley Marie</a> put it: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Who gets to decide?”</a></p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>Indeed, Heigl has come a long way since 2007. As is often the case with hindsight, we can’t help but wonder if we, the public and Hollywood, dulled out fair treatment to her back in those earlier years.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>With increasing public awareness about the often unfair treatment of women in the public eye, it’s hard not to feel a tinge of guilt about how things went down. Heigl is a bold woman who is unafraid of sharing her opinions. She does not fit into the demure, polite, and accommodating box that society often places women in. And one thing is for sure: she’s not backing down.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Heigl is currently slated to executive produce and star in <a href=#>the limited series Woodhull</a> about the first woman to ever run for president. There has been no official word on the release date of the series, nor any additional news since it was announced back in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZqORqbWmvsinnGaglZ60rXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-katherine-heigl.html&text=What%20happened%20to%20Katherine%20Heigl%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-katherine-heigl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-katherine-heigl.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Katherine%20Heigl%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-katherine-heigl.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Katherine%20Heigl%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-katherine-heigl.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Katherine%20Heigl%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-katherine-heigl.html&description=What%20happened%20to%20Katherine%20Heigl%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./antichrist-2009.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Antichrist movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2009)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-does-toya-turner-play-in-new-amsterdam-netflix-actress-parents-ethnicity-and-family-450947-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Does Toya Turner Play In New Amsterdam?
