He’s pushed the social envelope on adult animation with <a href=#>Family Guy</a>, <a href=#>American Dad</a>, and The Cleveland Show for over twenty years. He has even been deemed a pioneer of adult animated comedy’s modern age. His creatively dark humor has sparked numerous shows and movies, making him the second-richest animator in the world after <a href=#>The Simpsons</a> creator Matt Groening.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=95 data-current-count=95 data-injectable=false>He’s accomplished all of this, now just heading into his golden years, at the age of 50.</p><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>And with all the success he’s had in both television and film, MacFarlane however, hasn’t been as lucky in love. For many Hollywood celebrities (especially ones as wealthy as MacFarlane), maintaining a relationship amidst the hectic lifestyle of an A-lister can be a lot easier said than done.&nbsp;Nevertheless, MacFarlane is never hesitant about dating fellow celebrities. According to <a href=#>Dating Celebs</a>, he has actually been linked to a few recognizable ladies over the years.</p><h2 id=h-seth-mcfarlane-s-dating-history-explained data-injectable=false>Seth McFarlane’s dating history, explained</h2><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>During his time during the late 1990s as a writer for Fox’s comedy sketch show MAD TV, he started dating comedian and actress Nicole Sullivan, one of the original cast members. The couple would later part ways in 2000.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>Six years later, MacFarlane began dating actress Jessica Barth in 2006. They dated briefly and broke up later that year. But they remained such good friends that MacFarlane would eventually cast her to play the hot-headed Tammy Lynn in his first-ever live-action movie, <a href=#>Ted</a>, and its sequel, Ted 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-07-232044.png><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>After his short relationship with Barth ended, MacFarlane went on to date actress and producer Christa Campbell in 2006. They dated for a year and later broke up in 2007.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>Between 2007 and 2008, MacFarlane dated several famous actresses including Kat Foster, Camille Guatay, <a href=#>Amanda Bynes</a>, and <a href=#>The Vampire Diaries</a> actress Eliza Dushku.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MV5BMjEyNjM1OTc4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAzNzAzNA@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>He then dated Katie Sah and Kaylee Defer in 2009 before getting into a two-year relationship with reality TV star Trisha Cummings in 2010. This would prove to be the most time he’s spent dating a celebrity since breaking things off with Nicole Sullivan in 2000. MacFarlane soon began dating <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a> star <a href=#>Emilia Clarke</a> after he and Cummings ended things.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true>MacFarlane and Clarke dated for about a year but called it quits sometime in 2013. According to a source at <a href=#>E! News</a>, the couple could not make it work due to their busy schedules and long distance.&nbsp;“It was really a location challenge,” the outlet reported. “She has been in Europe shooting Game of Thrones, and he is based in California, so it was hard to make it work despite the distance. However, they have remained friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/445c67406f55ad8551d396aede3b409f8ce40d90.jpg><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>For a while after that, MacFarlane was single and seemingly not dating anyone. Perhaps he took a break to focus on newer projects like his live-action Fox Network television comedy, <a href=#>The Orville</a>. He soon wasn’t single, yet again, when he was seen with fellow Orville costar Halston Sage in 2017. The two dated for a while, but broke up sometime in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-07-234419.png><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=#>Creeto</a>, it may have been the first time in MacFarlane’s Hollywood dating experience that things did not end amicably. It was speculated that his split from Sage may have led to her sudden departure from the show in 2019; however, neither Sage nor MacFarlane has ever confirmed it.</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>MacFarlane moved on to another co-star from The Orville: Anne Winters. Winters joined the cast for the show’s third season when it premiered on <a href=#>Hulu</a>, in 2022. Unfortunately, <a href=#>the series didn’t go any further</a>. And honestly, no one quite knows if MacFarlane and Winters have either, since there are conflicting reports across the internet claiming they’ve broken up or are actually still together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-07-234820.png><h2 id=h-what-has-seth-mcfarlane-said-about-his-own-dating-history data-injectable=false>What has Seth McFarlane said about his own dating history?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-08-004228.png><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>Given MacFarlane’s unfortunate track record, there’s a good chance that he’s already single again. Despite his vast fortune, all of his accomplishments, and his uncanny ability to remain friends with most of his exes, it seems that MacFarlane still hasn’t been able to find “the one” yet. The Family Guy creator has recognized this and even compared himself to the famous Family Guy character, <a href=#>Brian Griffin</a> regarding his love life.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>“I have some Brian-type issues from time to time⏤looking for the right person⏤but I date as much as the next guy,” he said in a 2004 interview with <a href=#>The Daily Princetonian</a>.</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>You can look at that statement as either a good thing or a bad one. Brian is great but unlucky in love. And it’s also true that he has a bit of an ego, something that doesn’t have a long shelf-life in relationships.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>If MacFarlane is indeed living and “loving” like Brian, some self-reflection might be needed before jumping into the dating scene again. Hopefully, both he and Brian will one day be able to find true love. Until then, we wish them both the best of luck ⏤ they will need it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlo5rBqXnMmpqfmaKhrq%2Bx0mauop6VZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-seth-macfarlanes-wife.html&text=Who%20is%20Seth%20MacFarlanes%20wife%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-seth-macfarlanes-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-seth-macfarlanes-wife.html&title=Who%20is%20Seth%20MacFarlanes%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-seth-macfarlanes-wife.html&title=Who%20is%20Seth%20MacFarlanes%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-seth-macfarlanes-wife.html&title=Who%20is%20Seth%20MacFarlanes%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-seth-macfarlanes-wife.html&description=Who%20is%20Seth%20MacFarlanes%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emmy-combs-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-37465-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emmy Combs Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-jean-osgood-cbs-stalwart-charles-osgood-wife-article-107093202.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charles Osgood Wife: Who Is Jean Osgood?
