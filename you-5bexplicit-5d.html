The song starts by emphasizing how the sensations the singer experiences are 'for you,' whoever the addressee might be. At the same time, he takes a dismissive tone towards other people, refusing to care about them and 'pushing them away.'</p><br><p>The chorus is where the intensity bursts out - the singer cries and dies for this person, bearing the pain in his heart that he feels is real. He is ready to take everything as it comes and is willing even to lie for this person, portraying a deep devotion. However, this love is mixed with frustration towards drug users; the verses describe how these 'lonely people' come and beg for more, while the singer refuses to push for them.</p><br><p>Towards the end of the song, the singer voices his determination not to be part of this drug scene anymore, stating that he doesn't want it no more. However, the focus remains on how the sensations he feels in his heart are for the addressee.</p><br><p>Overall, "You" is a mix of love and frustration. The lyrics chart the extremes of this person's influence on the singer - from complete devotion to anger over their repeated drug use. Despite the intensity of these emotions, the song suggests that the singer keeps going, experiencing everything that comes his way.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by
